# Engineering Mathematics (EM)

This repository contains the projects developed for the course  
**“Engineering Mathematics (EM)”**, offered by the  
**Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering**,  
**University of Tehran – Spring 1404**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Haghi**.


## Overview

The works in this repository cover **Fourier series and transforms**, with applications in both mathematical modeling and practical signal/image processing.    
It also includes a research-based multimedia project created around the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its application in image compression**.
